# Contributing Guidelines

## Thank for taking the time to check out the repo and be willing to contribute!

If you have found an issue or would like to request a new feature, simply create a new issue. Be sure to fill out as much information as possible.

If this is your first open source contribution, please take a look at this [guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source).

Reporting Bugs & Feature Requests If you would like to submit a feature request or report a bug, we encourage you to first look through the [issues](https://github.com/acgtwentyone/react-native-easy-search-input/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/acgtwentyone/react-native-easy-search-input/pulls) before filing a new issue.

Submitting a Pull Request If you wish to submit a pull request for a new feature or issue, you should start by forking this repository first. This should get you setup on your local machine:

Setup Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you have not already. (We suggest you to use node v16.x.x). 

Fork the repo by running 

```
git clone https://github.com/*yourusername*/booktracks.git
``` 

Then navigate to the project by running the following command 

```
cd booktracks 
```

And then type

```
yarn install
```

OR 

```
npm install npm test
```

Once you have done this, create a new branch with a name that loosely describes the issue on which you will be working. 

Once you think you have the addressed the issue in question, submit a pull request to the master branch.
